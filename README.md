# FIDIUS fidius-cvedb

The FIDIUS CVE-DB Gem is used to run your own vulnerability database,
based on the National Vulnerability Database (NVD
[nvd.nist.gov](http://nvd.nist.gov/)).  It can be used for projects
that need access to vulnerability information, such as the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers.

It includes rake tasks to download and parse XML files provided by the
NVD, to store and update them in your personal database. Furthermore it includes
ActiveRecord models, migrations and example database configuration to store
Vulnerabilities easily.

This gem is being developed in the context of the student project "FIDIUS" at the
Universitaet Bremen; for more information about FIDIUS visit
[fidius.me](http://fidius.me/en).

## Installation

Simply install this package with Rubygems:

    $ gem install fidius-cvedb

Then add it to your gemfile (Rails 3)

    gem 'fidius-cvedb'
    gem 'mysql2' # only required when you use mysql db like in the example below

or environment.rb (prior Rails 3)

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'active_record'
    require 'fidius-cvedb'

Please note: The CVE-DB Gem has only been tested with Linux systems and might
not work with Windows.

## Configuration

The setup depends on the context you want to use the gem. It can be used in the
context of the FIDIUS Command&Control Server, or in your own Rails app. It might
access an already existing database or migrate a new one.

0. Go to your Rails-app folder and run `fidius-cvedb --standalone` or
   `fidius-cvedb --fidius`, depending on the context you are using it. For Rails
   versions prior 3 this will create symlinks for the Rake tasks.
1. Set up a new CVE Database if you need to or configure an existing one, add
   the CVE Database to your database.yml accordingly. Note that it must be named
   "cve_db":

          cve_db:
            adapter: mysql2
            encoding: utf8
            database: my_cve_database
            pool: 5
            username: my_username
            password: my_password
            host: localhost

2. When you created a new database, run `rake nvd:migrate` to create the tables
   needed.
3. When you set up your own database initialize it (note that it needs to be
   migrated before). Go to your Rails-app folder and run
   `rake nvd:initialize`. This will download all available information from the
   NVD, parse and store it in your database. This takes about 3 hours, depending
   on your machine. To keep your database up-to-date run `rake nvd:update`
   regularly, e.g. as a daily cron job.
4. Now you should be able to use the NVD entries, to test this go to your
   console (`rails console` | `ruby script/console`) and get an entry:

        $ FIDIUS::CveDb::NvdEntry.first
